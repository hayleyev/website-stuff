## A peculiar life form…

Hayley Evans (they/them) is a writer, editor, and self-professed dark weirdo. Their affinity lies with things that are morbid, philosophic, erotic, or strange (or an unholy combination thereof).

Their words have appeared in online art publications, where they specialize in writing about occult-themed photography, grotesque performance art, rogue taxidermy, existential cinema, and other forms of dark art. They have interviewed a range of well known and obscure artists, where their ability to detect artistic nuance uncovers compelling and hidden insights.

Hayley has worked as an editor for six years, polishing manuscripts for various publishing houses. They specialize in the (sub)genres of dark fantasy,  science fiction, post-apocalyptic fiction, intersectional feminist & LGBTQ+ literature, literary theory & criticism, and philosophy-forward works.

They hold an MA in English literature from the University of Victoria, where they focused on representations of queer bodies and eroticism in culturally reflective Canadian sci-fi literature.

They currently live in Montreal with a potentially demonic cat amidst a collection of dusty books and broken animal bones.

> “Hayley has worked for me on a couple of large-scale international editorial projects and I couldn’t be happier with their work. They have a fierce, almost obsessive, attention to detail and ruthless will to do each job to perfection. Hayley is simply the best editor I’ve ever worked with. I know their work greatly improved my own—and that of many more professional international writers as well!”

###### — Dr. Stephen Ross, General Editor of the Routledge Encyclopedia of Modernism

> “Hayley and I have worked together as editors in one form or another since our days copyediting for Routledge Press’s Encyclopedia of Modernism in 2014. They have distinguished themself repeatedly in their career as a meticulous and level-headed freelance editor. Their talent and reliability made them my first choice of hire as Senior Editor at FriesenPress and the professional I most hoped would come on board when I began my own editing company three years ago, which, thankfully, they did. In our five years of working together, they have always enriched our undertakings with their warmth, expertise, and fierce literary insight. I would endorse Hayley for any project they consider right for them, and I am as ever honoured to call them my peer, friend, and colleague.”

> "Like a cat, they have the gift of an enhanced sight. They read the darkness and translate their analytical and sensible vision into words. It is truly inspiring to collaborate with them."

###### — Marie-Lou Desmeules, living sculpture artist

> "Meticulous, intelligent, trustworthy—Hayley Evans is a gifted editor whose keen eyes and sharp red pencil have vastly improved the two book manuscripts I have sent their way. I am in awe of their uncanny ability to catch typographical errors, factual inconsistencies, and inelegant prose. Their calm professionalism and commitment to precision are unparalleled. I look forward to future collaborations."
