> “Hayley has worked for me on a couple of large-scale international editorial projects and I couldn’t be happier with her work. She has a fierce, almost obsessive, attention to detail and ruthless will to do each job to perfection. The results are always outstanding. Hayley is simply the best editor I’ve ever worked with. I know her work greatly improved my own—and that of many more professional international writers as well!”

> “Hayley has worked for the FriesenPress freelance editing department for a year now, and in that time has shown herself to be a meticulous and dependable editor, and a respectful and professional colleague. \[...\] She has established herself as the leading editor in terms of converting manuscript evaluations to editing sales. I believe this is down to \[her\] warm tone, obvious expertise, and fierce literary insight.”
