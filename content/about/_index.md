## A sentient life form…

Hayley Evans is a writer, editor, and self-professed dark weirdo. Her affinity lies with things that are morbid, philosophic, erotic, or strange (or an unholy combination thereof).

Her words, compelling and sometimes poetic, have appeared in online art publications, where she’s written prolifically about dark art: occult-themed photography, body horror sculptures, existential cinema, and beyond. Forever fascinated by philosophies of madness, politics of resistance, and answers to the eternal question “why,” she has interviewed well known and obscure artists about their creative vocations. Her ability to empathize and ask deeper questions allows her to connect with her subjects in a way that is rare to see.

Hayley has also worked as an editor for six years, polishing manuscripts for various publishing houses. Predictably, she specializes in the (sub)genres of dark fantasy, science fiction, post-apocalyptic fiction, feminist erotica, horror, and books of a philosophic nature.

In 2014, she graduated with an MA in English literature from the University of Victoria. Her final project analyzed representations of bodies and eroticism in culturally reflective Canadian sci-fi literature.

She currently lives in Montreal with a strange-looking cat and a collection of dusty books and broken animal bones.

> “Hayley has worked for me on a couple of large-scale international editorial projects and I couldn’t be happier with her work. She has a fierce, almost obsessive, attention to detail and ruthless will to do each job to perfection. Hayley is simply the best editor I’ve ever worked with. I know her work greatly improved my own—and that of many more professional international writers as well!”

###### — Dr. Stephen Ross, General Editor of the Routledge Encyclopedia of Modernism

> “Hayley has worked for the FriesenPress freelance editing department for a year now, and in that time has shown herself to be meticulous and dependable. She has established herself as a leading editor. I believe this is down to \[her\] warm tone, obvious expertise, and fierce literary insight.”

###### — Kate Juniper, former Senior Editor & Illustrations Coordinator, FriesenPress

> "Like a cat, she has the gift of an enhanced sight. She reads the darkness and translates her analytical and sensible vision into words. It is truly inspiring to collaborate with her."
