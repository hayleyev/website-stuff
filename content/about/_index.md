## A peculiar life form…

Hayley Evans is a writer, editor, and self-professed dark weirdo. Her affinity lies with things that are morbid, philosophic, erotic, or strange (or an unholy combination thereof).

Her words have appeared in online art publications, where she specializes in writing about occult-themed photography, grotesque performance art, existential cinema, and other forms of dark art. She has interviewed a broad range of well known and obscure artists, where her ability to detect artistic nuance uncovers compelling and hidden insights.

Hayley has worked as an editor for six years, polishing manuscripts for various publishing houses. She specializes in the (sub)genres of dark fantasy, science fiction, post-apocalyptic fiction, feminist erotica, horror, and philosophy-forward works.

She holds an MA in English literature from the University of Victoria, where she focused on representations of bodies and eroticism in culturally reflective Canadian sci-fi literature.

She currently lives in Montreal with a possibly-demonic cat amidst a collection of dusty books and broken animal bones.

> “Hayley has worked for me on a couple of large-scale international editorial projects and I couldn’t be happier with her work. She has a fierce, almost obsessive, attention to detail and ruthless will to do each job to perfection. Hayley is simply the best editor I’ve ever worked with. I know her work greatly improved my own—and that of many more professional international writers as well!”

###### — Dr. Stephen Ross, General Editor of the Routledge Encyclopedia of Modernism

> “Hayley has worked for the FriesenPress freelance editing department for a year now, and in that time has shown herself to be meticulous and dependable. She has established herself as a leading editor. I believe this is down to \[her\] warm tone, obvious expertise, and fierce literary insight.”

###### — Kate Juniper, former Senior Editor & Illustrations Coordinator, FriesenPress

> "Like a cat, she has the gift of an enhanced sight. She reads the darkness and translates her analytical and sensible vision into words. It is truly inspiring to collaborate with her."
