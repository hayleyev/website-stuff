<p>(I’ll think of some interesting things to say.)</p>

<h1 id="possibly-human">…possibly human.</h1>

<p>“Hayley has worked for me on a couple of large-scale international editorial projects and I couldn’t be happier with her work. She has a fierce, almost obsessive, attention to detail and ruthless will to do each job to perfection. The results are always outstanding. Hayley is simply the best editor I’ve ever worked with. I know her work greatly improved my own—and that of many more professional international writers as well!”</p>

<p>— Dr. Stephen Ross, Associate Professor and General Editor of the Routledge Encyclopedia of Modernism</p>

<p>“Hayley has worked for the FriesenPress freelance editing department for a year now, and in that time has shown herself to be a meticulous and dependable editor, and a respectful and professional colleague. [&hellip;] She has established herself as the leading editor in terms of converting manuscript evaluations to editing sales. I believe this is down to [her] warm tone, obvious expertise, and fierce literary insight.”</p>
